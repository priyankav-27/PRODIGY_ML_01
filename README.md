# PRODIGY_ML_01
Prodigy Machine Learning Internship Task 01
## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that accurately predicts house prices using the provided dataset. The model is trained on historical data containing information about house features and corresponding prices.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.
## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
  2. Install dependencies:
we can install the dependencies using pip
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```
## Usage
  Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/priyankav-27/PRODIGY_ML_01.git
  ```
## Evaluation
The performance of the model was evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) on a holdout test set.
## Results
The model achieved an RMSE of 50000 on the test set, indicating good predictive performance.
