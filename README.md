# PRODIGY_ML_01
Prodigy Machine Learning Internship Task 01
## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that accurately predicts house prices using the provided dataset. The model is trained on historical data containing information about house features and corresponding prices.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the Housing Prices dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) kaggle
## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
## Install dependencies:
we can install the dependencies using pip
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```
## Usage
  Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/priyankav-27/PRODIGY_ML_01.git
  ```
1. Open the `house price prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible notebook environment.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Alternatively, you can run the notebook cell by cell, or modify the code to suit your specific needs.
4. After training the model, you can use it to make predictions on new data by modifying the input features and running the prediction code.
## Evaluation
The performance of the model was evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) on a holdout test set.
## Results
The model achieved an RMSE of 50000 on the test set, indicating good predictive performance.
